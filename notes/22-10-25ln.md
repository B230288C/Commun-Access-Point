After I finished setting up the appointment controller and API route, I went to create the test file. During the first test, I found that there was a problem with the updateRepositoryRequest file. I checked and found that rule() was empty. After filling it in, this part was fine. 

I checked the test file and found that the value names were different, which would cause a mismatch, so I changed them to the names of the values ​​in the model. 

I also learned that the enum can only be modified in the controller, so that the user end cannot change the status at will. After that, there was no problem with the test.

JSX uses the message method {/*put in message*/}; HTML classes in React are called className. You can use functions within functions, but the outer function must have children, this allows to break down the part as needed. Using a Java array, you can store the key data in a repeating structure, and then using the map() function to display it as a single structure. ({function}) is used for data transfer.
