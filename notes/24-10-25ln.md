A custom hook allows you to avoid passing data through multiple layers and lets you import and use the hook directly in the component where you need it. However, if you want to share state, you need to use Context, and all components that use this hook must be wrapped with the corresponding Provider, although there is no need to pass data layer by layer, the components that the hook passes through on the way to the target component will still be re-rendered.

Combining useState with filter and map allows for dynamic searching. Set the input value to a state variable and use the onChange event to call a state update function. This way, whenever the input changes, the state variable is updated. By combining the updated state with filter and map, you can dynamically render a list that matches the search criteria.

You can use useRef to access a DOM element. First, define a variable inputRef and assign it the value returned by useRef. Then, attach it to the input element using ref={inputRef}. On the button, set onClick={() => inputRef.current.focus()}. This way, when the button is clicked, the cursor will automatically focus on the input field.
