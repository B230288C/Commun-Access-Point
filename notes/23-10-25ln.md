To react to rendering, you can use React's useState() function, for example, const[count,setCount] = React.useState(0); or directly import react's {useState}, useState (the value here is the initial value of count) and setCount will update the value of count and re-render when it is called.If it is a fixed value when calling, such as inputting setCount(count+1) twice, react will run both at the same time, resulting in the result of +1, but if it is a function, react will queue the execution, for example, inputting setCount(prev => prev+1) twice will result in +2.

The line onclick = {() => setCount(count+1)} means that setCount(count+1) will be run when the function is clicked. You can also use onclick = {() => { setCount(count+1); and then run multiple functions.

Data can be transmitted layer by layer, and any type of data can be transmitted. For example, function Parent(){const name = "Max"； return(<Child name={name} />);} is followed by function Child({name}){return <div>{name}</div> receiving function.

To make React render efficiently, avoid re-rendering components that don't need to update.
Don't wrap everything at the top level and pass props down unnecessarily—only render where state or props actually change.

{showChild && <Child data={passData} />}
Child will only be executed if showChild is true.
