I realized that since guests don't have accounts, all their information—name, ID/passport, phone number, email address, purpose, and responsible person—should be stored directly in the reservation table.

I implemented enumerations for reservation status and request validation, as well as a reservation model associated with Staff. Writing repositories and factory modules helped me manage CRUD operations and efficiently generate test data.

This was my first time actively using git branches. I found it important to stay aware of which branch I was working on, otherwise committing functionality beyond that branch would be a hassle. Also, pushes were done from main to main, and from branch to branch. I tried to push a branch to main, but it wouldn't work. So I merged the branch into main locally, then pushed it back to main.

This module gave me practical experience with validation, relationships, repositories, and test data setup. Next up: controller development, API routing, and test running.
